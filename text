Leonarch Dixon,

Forgive my tardy reply to your announcement. I've been enjoying the festivities in Perdan where knights from across the continent are gathered to tourney. The fishing is also excellent should you ever find yourself in need of a relaxing distraction from godhood.

We've heard many dark rumours in The Dales since you assumed authority over the Caligan... Host? Horde? I know not quite how to refer to a people who've travelled so far from their historic homeland and who deify a mortal man. All this seems... strange to us in The Dales, but clearly this is not the Caligus of old and therefore I'll extend you the benefit of the doubt, even considering your past crimes.

May the Vale of Westmoor prove a prosperous and fertile land in which to find a new identity for your people.

Under the circumstances I suppose it's only polite to thank you for vacating our western borders so throughly in recent days. Unlike some I prefer peace to war, and the restoration of Krimml to its rightful place amongst the Cities of the Coast will doubtless turn my people from some of the ire they feel towards your realm.

Ithica has chosen to raise their standard in Akesh Temple, and as their ally I have no grievance with that. Should their efforts prove incapable of imposing good order then The Dales will step in and reassert our sovereign claims.
